# DataMining-Twitter
Using the twitter api to datamine some tweets.
You need to make an account on the "Twitter developer platform" to get access to the twitter data. You can use this code to make a sector-diagram which describes peoples reaction on a special subject. You only have to insert your own tokens,key and secret to access the twitter api. The special subject we are checking depends on what your "film" variable says. The film variable is the twitter '#' this script does a sentiment analysis on.

This was a school project so most of our variables and comments are written in norwegian.
